# Decentralized-Color-Climate-Control

Modified split climate control system prototype. 
A "Smart Climate" system, based on a MCU device (control device) and a server part, based on the HTTP protocol.
A control device is implemented with ESP8266 MCU. 
A server part is implemented with HTTP and JSON. It is used to forecast data transmission.
A modern solution for the visual information with RGB-LEDs was used.
The connection between the MCU and the LED strip was implemented by Adafruit NeoPixel library.
The results of the layout confirmed the efficiency and effectiveness of the developed control device.
